# Minimum Path Sum

## Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner that minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move **either down or right** at any point in time.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
grid = [
  [1, 3, 1],
  [1, 5, 1],
  [4, 2, 1]
]
